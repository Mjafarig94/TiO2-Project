# TiO2-Project
The codes and models to predict the required UV exposure time for any TiO2 composition and water Contact angle

The codes for training and also the final models ar provided.
To use the training files make sure to have the data file (CA.csv) in the same category as the code files.
To use the final models you should use the final scaler for each model (which is saved as .pkl) to scale the input and inverse the output for real UV exposure time.
See the example file in the Final model folder for more details.
